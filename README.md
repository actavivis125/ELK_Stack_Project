# ELK_Stack_Project
ELK Stack for Monitoring
This is a project I worked on in the cybersecurity bootcamp where several resources were used to deploy an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Filebeat [instead of logstash in this instance, so I guess it's more of an EFK Stack], and Kibana). This Stack's intended function is to be a monitoring server to aggregate logs from two web servers that have DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web Application) installed on them. I utilized Docker and Ansible to install the DVWA and ELK Stack containers on the VMs. I will provide more details for this project within this repository.
